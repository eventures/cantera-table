INTRODUCTION

  To use this software, you need a schema file.  This is a simple ASCII file,
  designed to be editable with an ordinary text editor.  Here's an example:

    summary      /var/lib/search/summary:html  0
    summary      /var/lib/search/summary:pdf   1000000000
    index        /var/lib/search/index:html
    index        /var/lib/search/index:pdf
    time-series  /var/lib/search/nasdaq

  The three supported table types are "summary", "index" and "time-series".
  What follows is a brief description of each type.

SUMMARY TABLES

  A summary table consists of pairs of strings.  The first string is the name
  of a document, and the second string is a JSON object describing the
  document.

  The data in all summary tables are mapped to the same address space.  The
  integer value in the third column of the schema file indicates the starting
  offset for the summary table.

INDEX TABLES

  An index table consists of strings coupled with an array of integer/floating
  point value pairs.  The integer represents offsets into the summary table
  address space.  The floating point value represents relevance, dates or any
  other data you might want to rank or filter your search queries by.

TIME SERIES TABLES

  This table is stored exactly the same way as an index table.  The difference
  is in its interpretation.  It is a convenient format for storing data like
  daily stock market closing prices, or number of visitors to a web site per
  day.
