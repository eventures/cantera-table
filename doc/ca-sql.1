.PP
.SH "NAME"
ca-sql \- syntax of the Cantera Table query language
.SH "STATEMENTS"
.TP
\fBCREATE TABLE\fR name \fB(\fRcolumns\fB) WITH (PATH =\fR path\fB)\fR
Creates a table at the given path.  If the backing table does not exist, it will be created when it is first accessed.
.TP
\fBDROP TABLE\fR name
Removes the table with the given name from the schema.  The backing file is not removed.
.TP
\fBSHOW TABLES\fR
An alias for \fBSELECT * FROM ca_catalog.ca_tables\fR
.TP
\fBSELECT\fR expression \fB[,\fR expression\fB...]\fR \fBFROM\fR table \fB[WHERE\fR expression\fB] [OFFSET\fR integer\fB] [LIMIT\fR integer\fB]\fR
Retrieves rows from the specified table, and prints the value of the listed expressions as in the context of each row.

If the \fBWHERE\fR keyword is used, only rows where its parameter expression evaluates to \fBTRUE\fR will be retrieved.  Note that this expression MUST be boolean.
.TP
\fBSET OUTPUT FORMAT\fR format
Sets the format used in response to \fBSELECT\fR statements.  Supported formats are:
.RS
.TP
\fBCSV\fR
Values are cast to strings and separated by \fBTAB\fR.  Rows are separated by \fBLF\fR.  To prevent ambiguity, \fBTAB\fR and \fBLF\fR characters within strings are escaped to avoid ambiguity.  This is the default output format.
.TP
\fBJSON\fR
The result set is printed as an array of objects in JSON format.
.RE
.TP
\fBSET TIME FORMAT\fR format
Sets the format that will be used to output string.  The default is
\fB'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:S'\fR, the ISO 8601 combined date and time format.  Use
\fB'%s'\fR to get the number of seconds since UNIX epoch.
.SH "EXPRESSIONS"
.TP
lhs \fBAND\fR rhs
\fBTRUE\fR if \fBlhs\fR and \fBrhs\fR are both equal to \fBTRUE\fR, \fBFALSE\fR otherwise.
.TP
lhs \fBOR\fR rhs
\fBTRUE\fR if either \fBlhs\fR or \fBrhs\fR is equal to \fBTRUE\fR, \fBFALSE\fR otherwise.
.TP
lhs \fBrelational operator\fR rhs
\fBTRUE\fR if \fBlhs\fR relates to \fBrhs\fR as suggested by the operator, \fBFALSE\fR otherwise.  The operators are \fB<\fR, \fB<=\fR, \fB=\fR, \fB>=\fR, \fB>\fR and \fB!=\fR.  The operators work with \fBTEXT\fR values as well as numerical values.
.TP
subject \fBLIKE\fR pattern
Both \fBsubject\fR and \fBpattern\fR must be strings.  Returns \fBTRUE\fR if
the subject matches the pattern, \fBFALSE\fR otherwise.  The pattern is applied
to the entire subject, not just a substring.  A \fB_\fR character in the
pattern matches any character in the subject.  A \fB%\fR character in the
pattern matches any number of any character in the subject.
.TP
\fB(\fRexpr\fB)\fR
Returns the value of \fBexpr\fR.  The parantheses instruct the parser about the
order in which operators take precedence.
